2. What order should you watch in?
3. How I'm running my code

## Section 2: Big O Notation

### Intro to Big O
- Big O Slides https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/big-o-notation#/

### Timing Our Code
The  Problem with Time
- different machines will record different times
- the same machine will record different times!
- for fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough?

### Counting Operations
- rather than counting seconds which are so variable, let's count the number of simple operations the computer has to perform.
- depending on what we count, the number of operations can be as low as 2n or as high as 5n + 2
- but regardless of the exact number, the number of operations grows roughly proportionally with n
