// Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
"add two numbers and find the total"
// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- integers?
- floats?
- what about strings for large numbers
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- integers?
- floats?
- string?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information?)
- only one input?
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
- sum
- num1, num2
